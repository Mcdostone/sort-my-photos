#Sort my photos

Once uppon a time in the Studio club at TELECOM Nancy, a idiot guy who takes a thousand of photos per hour.
The big problem with this guy is he doesn't select good photos. So another idiot guy do this task with the f*cking explorer.exe and the Windows Photo Viewer.


In order to facilitate this task, I decided to make a software.

## Features

 - Have a preview of a media (for the moment only images)
 - Help the user to select good medias with visual indicators
 - Speed up the sorting process
 - Save an history of work on medias (logs)
 - Add tags for a given media
